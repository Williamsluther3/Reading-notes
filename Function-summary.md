# Functions Summary

## In this summary i will go over the basics of creating a function and what it all in tells for it to work and more so work how you want it to. To get started we need to understand how the computers reads your code or the Control flow.  

### *Control flow*  

Is the order in which the computer executes statements in a script. Code is run in order from the first line in the file to the last line, unless the computer runs across the (extremely frequent) structures that change the control flow, such as conditionals and loops. And, to get a reaction like question and answer or user response you will need to learn to create a function. 

### *Function*

Functions: code designed to perform a particular task, ways that you can create commands that will have steps of code that will repeat whenever you use this command: 

function addTwoNumbers(){  
    let num1 = 7;  
    let num2 = 4;  
    let sum = num1 = num2;  
    Console.log(sum);  
    return sum;  
}

Function is executed when "something" invokes it (calls it).  

### *Invoking*:  

Invoking is calling or using the function: 

*addTwoNumbers();*  
And in doing this (invoking the function) the Parentheses () at the end of the invoke is what is triggering the command or function.  

### And this is how you can have the system greet users, ask their names and respond to the user in a statement with their name in the statement.
