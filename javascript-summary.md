# JavaScript Summary

## *JavaScript* is a scripting language that is used in Web development. JavaScript allows you to implement complex features on the web page. Anything that is more than just static information JavaScript is most likely involved.

## Variables

*Variables* are containers for holding values that enable you to:  

* Assign values to the Variable.  
* Retrieve data from them.
* Perform operations using their values.  

You are able to do these things by *Declaring a Variable*

## What is Declaring:

To declare in JavaScript means to create a variable and assign value. There are two ways to declare, by using Let and const. 

*Let*: is used when the value is one that is able to be changed.  

    * let u = umbrella
    * let myage = 49

*Const*: is used when the value is not able to be changed.  

    * const myName = Luther  
    * const y = 2  

## Assignment operator

*Assignment Operator* in JavaScript is represented by the equals sign (=). Its primary purpose is to assign a value to a variable or property.

    * x = x + 5
    * y = 10

## Promt and Confirm

*Prompt* Is using script that will show  a pop-up window with the text provided as the first parameter and with a textbox the user can fill in. When the user presses OK, the value in the text box will be returned by the prompt() function.

    * console.log("i am in the HTML");
      alert("Welcome to my page");
    
      const usersName = prompt("What is your name?");

In the exabple once on the page a pop up with welcome to my page will come uo, the user will selct ok or cancel. Then it will ask their name, once they place their name in and hit ok then come s the confirm.

*Confirm* It allows the developer to ask a Yes/No question. Calling the confirm() function will show a pop-up window with the provided texts and with two buttons. If the user presses OK the confirm() function will return true. At this point it will return:

document.write("Hi")

And Hi will be printed on the page.
