# Text Editor, Command lines & Commands

## What is a Text editor
A text editor is a piece of software that you download and install on your computer, or you access online through your web browser, that allows you to write and manage text, especially the text that you write to build a web site.  

When using a text editor you should always have tools or features that help make editing you text easier  

## What are four features to look for in a text editor  
1. *Code completion:* allows you to start typing, and the code completion
feature will display possible suggestions based on what you originally
typed. 
1. *Syntax highlighting:* a feature that takes the text you
type, and makes it more noticeable by colorizing the text.
1. *Themes:* It allow you to change the color of
the background of your text editor, the series of colors in your text,
and sometimes themes will affect other aspects of your text editing
software as well.    
1. *Extentions:* Extensions are like
plugins for your text editor, that allow you to have superpowers that
you wouldnâ€™t have otherwise.   

While on your computer system you are able to move about, create files, folders and directories all by giving your system commands to do so. You are probably used to using a GUI (graphical user interface) on you Windows or Mac systems by just clicking a button. But, another way is done through a ### command line.   
A *command line* is a text based interface to the system you are able to enter commands by typing them on the keyboard and feedback will be given to you similarly as text.   
## Here are some common commands and their functions   
1. *pwd* (Print Working directory): It tells you where you are currently or present working directory is.
2. *ls* (list): what is there in your current Directory (location)
3. *cd* (Change Directory): This allows you to move around in the system, move to a different directory.
4. *mkdir* (Make Directory): Create a new folder (directory).
5. *touch*: Create a new file

When you want the system to perform multiple action you would give those instructions in multiple lines of commands and arguments. Here are some commands and arguments and the action the system will perform.   
## Commands and Argument output
1. *cd projects*: This will change from your current directory to project.
2. *mkdir new-project*: This will create a new folder (directory) named New Project
3. *touch new-project/newfile.md*: This will create a new Markdown file inside of the folder New Project
4. *cd..*: This will change directory going backwards, in other words it will take you back two files or folders that you were previously in.
5. *ls projects/new-project*: This will list what's in the New project which is located inside of the project directory.

The sky is the limit on what you can do with the command line so let's explore.
