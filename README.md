Hello everyone,

 My name is Luther Williams [GitHub Profile](https://github.com/Williamsluther3), I am here to introduce to you the Growth Mindset,  
 and how you can catapult your performance to new heights by switching your thought pattern to it. 

 **What is Growth Mindset**

> Having the ability to push past any difficult, stressfull situation or distraction that may get in the way of you completing a task or reaching your goal.

It's easy to get sidetracked after sitting trying to figure out a difficult problem that seems to have no good answer. Your mind starts to wonder and you find yourself clicking on websites, texting on your phone or just about anything that keeps you from completing your task.  

**How to turn on your Growth Mindset**

- Take sometime (5-10 minutes) and step away from your task and go back with a fresh mind.
-  Chisel at the task bit by bit until you complete it.
- Keep reminding yourself of what it is you are trying to accomplish
- Don't be afraid to ask for help

**Motivating Growth Mindset factors**

* What are you trying to achieve
* Who do you do it all for
* What's you overall goal
* How do you want to be viewed

  There are many reasons to take on a Growth mindset it's up to you to decide what's the motivating reason for you.

  #### When creating a Heading you use a pound or Hash tag symbol: #.
 [^1]: The hash tag symbols create Headings in different sizes pending on how many you use. 
  [^1]: You are able to use up to 6 hash tags at a time.
  [^1]: One hash tag with a space will render you the largest size Heading and six hash tags will render the smallest Heading.

**When you want your text to be bold** you will use two Asterisks or two Underscores before and after the text you want to be bold. 
Though you are able to use both the asterisk and understores to bold your text, due to the fact not all applications react to underscores the same
it is best practise to use the asterisk instead of the underscore. 

***When you want italicize your text*** you will use an Asterisk or a Underscore before and after the text or phrase you want to be italicize. 
Though you are able to use the asterisk and understores to italicize your text and phases, due to the fact not all applications react to underscores the same

### Creating Links

When creating or adding links in an md you will simply placing what you would like you link's title or name to say inside brakets [] 
and then place the URL inside parentheses (). the URL can be copied and paste inside the parentheses.

When creating documents, pages and sites you may have to list out items.
- You would do this for unordered list by using dashes -  
-  plus +   
- asterisk *  
-  and a space and the word you want to be in the list. you will hit enter for it to drop to the next line and repeat with the symbols and space.
**If you need for it to be numbered** 
1.  you would use the number 1 and period 1.  
2. a space then the word you want listed.  
3. Hit enter and repeat as many times needed.
