## Hello everyone,

 My name is Luther Williams [GitHub Profile](https://github.com/Williamsluther3), I am here to introduce to you the Growth Mindset,  
 and how you can catapult your performance to new heights by switching your thought pattern to it. 

### **What is Growth Mindset**

> Having the ability to push past any difficult, stressfull situation or distraction that may get in the way of you completing a task or reaching your goal.

It's easy to get sidetracked after sitting trying to figure out a difficult problem that seems to have no good answer. Your mind starts to wonder and you find yourself clicking on websites, texting on your phone or just about anything that keeps you from completing your task.  

### **How to turn on your Growth Mindset**

1. Take sometime (5-10 minutes) and step away from your task and go back with a fresh mind.
1.  Chisel at the task bit by bit until you complete it.
1. Keep reminding yourself of what it is you are trying to accomplish
1. Don't be afraid to ask for help

### **Motivating Growth Mindset factors**

* What are you trying to achieve
* Who do you do it all for
* What's you overall goal
* How do you want to be viewed

  There are many reasons to take on a Growth mindset it's up to you to decide what's the motivating reason for you.
