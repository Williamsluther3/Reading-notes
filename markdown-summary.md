### What is Markdown

- Markdown is a simplified markup language used to format plain text. 
- That means you can take regular text and with a varity of symbols format it to be used in HTML.

### Why Use Markdown:

* Markdown is used because it is easier to learn, use and read then HTML. 
* You use simple text and symbols to do and get the same result you would in HTML. 

### What type of symbols are used in Markdown:

#### When creating a Heading you use a pound or Hash tag symbol: #.

* The hash tag symbols create Headings in different sizes pending on how many you use.  
* You are able to use up to 6 hash tags that all render different affects.

1. ***One hash tag with a space will render you the largest size Heading***
1. ***Six hash tags will render the smallest Heading***.

**When you want your text to be bold** you will use two Asterisks or two Underscores before and after the text you want to be bold. 
Though you are able to use both the asterisk and understores to bold your text, due to the fact not all applications react to underscores the same
it is best practise to use the asterisk instead of the underscore. 

***When you want italicize your text*** you will use an Asterisk or a Underscore before and after the text or phrase you want to be italicize. 
Though you are able to use the asterisk and understores to italicize your text and phases, due to the fact not all applications react to underscores the same
it is best practise to use the asterisk instead of the underscore.

- plus +
- asterisk *  
- and a space and the word you want to be in the list. you will hit enter for it to drop to the next line and repeat with the symbols and space.
**If you need for it to be numbered**
